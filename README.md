# ABOUT
This project contains the code for data scraping, data cleaning, and modeling used to generate forecasts shown on [econforecasting.com](https://econforecasting.com).

# RUN
This code is developed locally on a Windows machine and deployed locally to an Ubuntu VPS. The modeling code is primarily run in R (>=4.1.2) but some scraping scripts make calls to Python (=3.8.7). Modules are imported wholesale using the `reticulate` package. Data and model features are stored in a Postgres/TimescaleDB server hosted on the VPS.
